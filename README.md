# Hello World!
The time honored tradition when learning a new system or syntax.

Hello, my name is Tyler Smith. If I had to describe who I want to be and what I want to do in life, I would say that I am meant to be: 
* A leader
* A creative
* An organizer
* An enthusiast

A little about me (in long form): I met my wife in high school marching band. I attended the University of Louisville for 2 years and finished my BSIT through University of Phoenix online. I am a renaissance reenactor, my wife and I make our costumes by hand. I love to cook, and I think I'm pretty good at it. I love learning new syntaxes and systems, my favorite is .NET. I write short stories based on vivid dreams. I know way too much about the coffee industry, from farm to cafe. I need to get my foot in the door.
